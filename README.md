# Etch-A-Sketch
A classic Etch-A-Sketch application built as a project for The Odin Project's curriculum. This web-based drawing pad allows users to create digital sketches by hovering their mouse over a grid.

### Features

**Interactive Grid:** The app generates a dynamic grid of squares based on user input.

**Drawing Functionality:** Simply hover your mouse over the grid to "sketch" in black.

### Color Modes:

* **Black & White:** The default drawing mode.

* **Random Color:** Switch to this mode to draw with a new random color on every square.

* **Grid Resizing:** Use the "Set Size" button to create a new grid of up to 100x100 squares.

* **Clear Canvas:** The "Clear" button instantly resets the grid, allowing you to start a new drawing.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5

* CSS3

* JavaScript

###What I Learned
This project was a great opportunity to practice and solidify my understanding of fundamental front-end development concepts, including:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and removing elements on the page.

* **Event Handling:** Responding to user input like mouse hovers and button clicks.

* **CSS Grid:** Creating flexible and responsive grid layouts without relying on external libraries.

* **JavaScript Logic:** Implementing the core functionality and user interactions.
