# Etch-A-Sketch
A classic Etch-A-Sketch application built as a project for The Odin Project's curriculum. This web-based drawing pad allows users to create digital sketches by hovering their mouse over a grid.

### Features

* **Interactive Grid:** The app generates a dynamic grid of squares based on user input.

* **Drawing Functionality:** Simply hover your mouse over the grid to "sketch" in the selected color.

* **Grid Resizing:** Use the "Size" button to create a new grid of up to 100x100 squares.

* **GridLines:** Use the "Gridlines" checkbox to show or hide the grid.

* **Pen Enable/Disable:** Use the 'spacebar' to enable or disable active drawing.

* **Shake:** Click anywhere on the red frame to 'shake' the etch-a-sketch and erase your drawing.

### Color Modes:

* **Black:** The default drawing mode.

* **RGB:** Switch to this mode to draw with a new random color on every square.

* **Shade:** Shades the square by 10%.

* **White (eraser):** Resets the square to white.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5

* CSS3

* JavaScript

### What I Learned
This project was a great opportunity to practice and solidify my understanding of fundamental front-end development concepts, including:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and removing elements on the page.

* **Event Handling:** Responding to user input like mouse hovers and button clicks.

* **CSS Grid:** Creating flexible and responsive grid layouts without relying on external libraries.

* **JavaScript Logic:** Implementing the core functionality and user interactions.
